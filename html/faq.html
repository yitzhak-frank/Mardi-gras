                    <p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called
                        "The Greatest Free Show on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as
                        the parades pass.</p>

                <div class="answer answer-2">
                    <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on Jan. 6 (the Feast
                        of the Epiphany) and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash
                        Wednesday when Lent begins. It is also common for people to refer to the entire season as Mardi
                        Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras Day." Locals tend to call the season
                        "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."</p>

                    <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone
                        else, and the elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.

                <div class="answer answer-4">
                    <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings,
                        while others invite a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by
                        the School of Design, who sponsors the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the day before the
                        parade.</p>

                <div class="answer answer-6">
                    <p>City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades. The governments issue
                        parade permits, but that is the extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and
                        coordinate their own parades.</p>

                <div class="answer answer-7">
                    <p>Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together year
                        round to plan their parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are
                        known, is individually funded by its members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of
                        krewe-related merchandise to their members, and fundraising. Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes
                        have corporate sponsors.

                        The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only
                        involvement is to issue parade permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and
                        coordinates its own parade.</p>
